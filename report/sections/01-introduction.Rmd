# Introduction

This project is largely based on the chapter 5 and chapter 6 of the book Introduction to Statistical Learning by James El. As a case study, the book has introduced a credit data set for us to apply five different regression models. In the later sections, we are going to cover in details regarding the data set, the methods and the specific analysis.
