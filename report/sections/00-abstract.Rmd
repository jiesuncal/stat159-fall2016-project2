# Abstract

In this project, we are trying to collaboratively perform a predictive modeling process with cross-validation on the Credit data set using five regression models, in a reproducible workflow. The motivation of the analysis is to find out how the variables (age, education, income etc.) affect the balance of a credit card user. With different regression modelâ€™s analysis, we are hoping to compare our regression models with a benchmark regression model to find out the best regression model for this specific data set.
