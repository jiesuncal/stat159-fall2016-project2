# Reports

For the `reports` folder, we are actually assembling the final report each individual chapter from the `sections` folder. For the `sections` folder, we have `00-abstract.Rmd`, `01-introduction.Rmd`, `02-data.Rmd`, `03-methods.Rmd`, `04-analysis.Rmd`, `05-results.Rmd`, `06-conclusion.Rmd`. The final `report.Rmd` is assembled using `Make` commands by combining the 6 individual sections together.


# Credit
This project is largely based on the chapter 5 and chapter 6 of the book Introduction to Statistical Learning by James El. As a result, a lot of the knowledge and resources are taken from the textbook.
